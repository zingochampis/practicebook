Sarvagjna was born into a shudra family she was orphaned at the age of five and had to make her own way in life as a beggar. Sarvagjna lived as a beggar until she was an adolescent. Up to that age she learned to enjoy life in whatever way she could. Sarvagjna had no friends. She was shunned by other beggars and therefore became accustomed to solitude. She found shelter wherever she could and found solace in the daily wonders of nature. There were always animals, birds, flowers, and trees at which to marvel so, at the age of nine she began to roam. At first, she did not travel far from her place of birth in Andhra Pradesh but by the age of eleven she was wandering throughout India; simply to see whatever she could see.
